Prediction of Airbnb listings prices in neighbourhoods of Barcelona, Spain

### Context
Analysis submitted as final assessment for the Programing Tools for Urban Analytics course of my MSc in Urban Analytics. OLS and supervised machine learning algorithms (Lasso Regression (L1), Ridge Regression (L2) and ElasticNet) are trained and tested to predict Airbnb listings prices in Barcelona. Dataset used was obtained from Kaggle and is composed of data from the Inside Airbnb project and official data from Barcelona City Council's Municipal Data Office. Different from other Airbnb price prediction analyses, here I attempted to include variables with measurements typically related to displacement and neighbourhood change phenomena to see if they also have an influence on price (together with property characteristics and rating scores variables).
